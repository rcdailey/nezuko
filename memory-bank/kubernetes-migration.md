# Initiative: Kubernetes Migration

## Status

- **Phase**: Implementation
- **Progress**: 1/49 services migrated (homer complete, 48 remaining)

## Objective

Transform Docker Compose-based homelab into production-ready Kubernetes environment with a
learning-first approach. Successfully migrate all homelab services from Docker Compose to Kubernetes
while building deep understanding of cloud-native patterns, multi-node architecture, and production
best practices.

## Current Focus

Recommend next service for migration based on learning progression and complexity. Evaluate
remaining services to select optimal next target that builds on Homer migration lessons while
introducing new concepts appropriately.

## Task Checklist

- [x] Memory Bank Structure - Successfully created comprehensive memory bank system
- [x] Homer Migration - Successfully migrated to Kubernetes at `home.dailey.app`
- [x] SWAG Integration - Validated hybrid architecture with nginx-ingress + SWAG backend
- [x] Storage Validation - Confirmed Rook Ceph cluster fully operational
- [x] Service Survey - Identified 49 total services across 15 compose stacks (1 complete, 48
  remaining)
- [ ] Next Migration Selection - Choose appropriate next target based on learning objectives
- [ ] Next Service Migration - Complete second service migration
- [ ] Pattern Validation - Test documented patterns against real implementation
- [ ] k9s Practice - Hands-on cluster exploration and management
- [ ] Progressive Complexity - Work through remaining services by difficulty

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze remaining services** for migration complexity and learning value
2. **Recommend next target** based on educational progression and technical patterns
3. **Plan migration approach** for selected service
4. **Implement migration** following established patterns

- **homer** (1 service) - ✅ COMPLETED

**EXCLUDED FROM MIGRATION**:

- **swag** - Remains as backend for hybrid architecture (not migrated)

### Service Complexity Analysis

- **Single Service**: 8 applications (simple migrations)
- **Multi-Service**: 7 applications (16 total services)
- **Complex Stacks**: 2 applications (21 total services)
- **Total**: 49 services across 15 compose stacks

### Current Cluster State

- **Nodes**: 3-node K3s cluster (lucy, marin, nami) - All Ready
- **Resource Usage**: Excellent capacity available (2-3% CPU, 2-30% memory)
- **Storage**: Rook Ceph fully operational (3 OSDs, 3 monitors, 2 managers)
- **Storage Classes**: `rook-ceph-block` and `local-path` available
- **Networking**: nginx-ingress controller with SWAG backend integration

### Technical Patterns Established

- **Multi-Node Architecture**: Clear requirements for pod mobility
- **Storage Strategy**: PersistentVolumeClaims with rook-ceph-block
- **Ingress Pattern**: Priority-based routing with hybrid SWAG backend
- **Tool Hierarchy**: k9s > Helmfile > Kustomize > kubectl

### Docker to Kubernetes Translation Examples

```yaml
# Volume Pattern
# Docker Compose: bind mounts
volumes:
  - ./config:/app/config

# Kubernetes: PVC mounts
volumeMounts:
- name: config-storage
  mountPath: /app/config
volumes:
- name: config-storage
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: app-config-pvc
```

```yaml
# Ingress Pattern
# Docker Compose: labels for reverse proxy
labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.app.rule=Host(`app.domain.com`)"

# Kubernetes: Ingress resource
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app.dailey.app
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Progress & Context Log

### 2024-06-19 - Cluster Assessment and Homer Migration Success

Completed comprehensive cluster evaluation revealing excellent infrastructure status. Successfully
migrated Homer dashboard to Kubernetes, validating hybrid architecture approach with nginx-ingress +
SWAG backend integration. Homer now accessible at `home.dailey.app` with full functionality
preserved.

**Key Achievements**:

- **Infrastructure Status**: 3-node K3s cluster with excellent resource availability
- **Storage Success**: Rook Ceph fully operational with proper storage classes
- **Networking Validation**: Hybrid routing working perfectly with priority-based ingress
- **Migration Pattern**: Established successful Docker→Kubernetes translation approach

**Technical Insights**:

- SWAG integration enables gradual migration without service disruption
- PersistentVolumeClaims with rook-ceph-block provide reliable multi-node storage
- k9s significantly improves learning experience through visual cluster management
- Configuration verification pattern prevents assumption-based errors

### 2024-06-19 - Memory Bank System Implementation

Successfully transformed copilot-instructions into comprehensive memory bank structure. Created
modular knowledge organization with clear separation of concerns and cross-references between system
components.

**Memory Bank Components Created**:

- Core documentation and learning methodology
- Migration patterns and technical examples
- Tool usage hierarchy and best practices
- Approval workflow for protected learning environment

**Process Improvements**:

- Mandatory approval workflow protects against accidental changes
- Educational approach prioritizes understanding over quick fixes
- Regular memory bank updates improve knowledge retention
- Systematic documentation of lessons learned and patterns

### 2024-12-21 - Comprehensive Service Survey and Migration Planning

Completed detailed analysis of all Docker Compose stacks, revealing 49 total services across 15
compose files. Much larger scope than initially estimated (13 → 49 services). Current status: 1
migrated (homer), 48 remaining.

**Service Inventory Breakdown**:

- **Simple Applications (8)**: Single-service migrations ideal for learning
- **Medium Complexity (16)**: Multi-service applications with databases/dependencies
- **Complex Applications (25)**: Large stacks like media automation (16 services) and LibreChat (5
  services)

**Key Findings**:

- **Media stack** is massive: 16 interconnected services (Plex, Sonarr variants, Radarr variants,
  etc.)
- **LibreChat** has 5 services: API + 4 supporting databases/search engines
- **Authentik/Immich** each have 4 services with databases and supporting components
- **FileRun** has 4 services including Elasticsearch and Tika for search/indexing

**Architecture Decisions**:

- SWAG remains as backend for hybrid architecture (not migrated)
- Focus on learning progression: single services → multi-service → complex stacks
- Each migration builds foundational patterns for increasingly complex deployments
